# Frontend
<ul>
    <li>Javascript</li>

<ul>

    <li>Laravel 9</li>

# Laravel and React Merge
<p>They are integrated through laravel ui package. More specificaly, with this package, a scaffolding for React is created inside the resources Laravel folder.
So, instead of two separated folders, like "backend" and "frontend", here React and Laravel are "merged" in the same folder structure, and a blade view named commonly as "main" is used to render React JS.</p>

# Commands
<p>To initiate Laravel server just type in the terminal and in project root folder.</p>
<b>php artisan serve</b>
